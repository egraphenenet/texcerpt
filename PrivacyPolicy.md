# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 1 January 2025

This privacy policy is applicable to the “Texcerpt: Image to Text” (referred to as "the App") for mobile devices, which was developed by eGraphene.net (referred to as "Us" or “We"), as a Freemium service.

## What information does the App obtain?

The App does not collect any information about the user for our own purposes.

The free version of the app uses third-party advertising services to display ads. These services may collect and use user data, such as device ID, location, and browsing behavior, to deliver targeted advertisements. Please note that we do not collect or use this data ourselves, but we want to inform you about the practices of our advertising partners. We may share your information with third parties in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.

The paid version of the app does not have advertisements and therefore has no tracking by either us or third-party advertising services. 

## Does the App collect location information of the device?

This App does not gather any information about the location of your mobile device.

## Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the App?

The App utilizes third-party services, including the Gemini API, which may have access to certain data when you use the "Summaries" features (including “Youtube URL summary” and “Text summary” functions). When you use these features, the content you are summarizing within the app may be shared with the Gemini API for processing. Please note that Gemini has its own privacy policy that governs how your data is handled. For more information on how the Gemini API processes your data, please review their privacy policy here: [Gemini Apps Privacy](https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13594961?hl=en)
